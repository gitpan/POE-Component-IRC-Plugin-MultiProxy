NAME
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MultiProxy - A multi-server IRC proxy

SYNOPSIS
     use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MultiProxy;

     my $proxy = POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MultiProxy->new(
         Listen_port = 12345,
         Password    = 'foobar',
     );

     $irc->plugin_add(
         MultiProxy => $proxy,
         network    => 'freenode',
     );

METHODS
  "new"
    Creates a new MultiProxy plugin object. Takes the following arguments:

    'Password' (required), the password you will use when connecting to the
    proxy.

    'Listen_port' (required), the port you want the proxy to listen on.

    'Listen_host' (optional), the host you want the proxy to listen on.
    Defaults to '0.0.0.0'.

    'Away_msg' (optional), the away message you want to use when no clients
    are connected.

    'SSL_key', the name of a file containing an SSL key for the listener to
    use, if you want to enable SSL.

    'SSL_cert', the name of a file containing an SSL certificate for the
    listener to use, if you want to enable SSL.

    'Recall_mode', how you want messages to be recalled. Available modes
    are:

    'missed' (the default): MultiProxy will only recall the channel messages
    you missed since the last time you detached from MultiProxy.
    'none': MultiProxy will not recall any channel messages.
    'all': MultiProxy will recall all channel messages.

    Note: MultiProxy will always recall *private messages* that you missed
    while you were away, regardless of this option.

TODO
    Look into using POE::Component::Server::IRC as an intermediary for
    multiple clients.

    Keep recall messages away from prying eyes, instead of in /tmp.

    Add proper tests.
